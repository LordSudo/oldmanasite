**I am Lord Sudo.**  
Red teamer. CTF tactician. Student of systems—and their failure points.  
Proud operative of **p3rf3ctr00t**.

This space is not a blog. It is a ledger.  
A chronicle of engagements, extractions, exploits—both technical and psychological.

I navigate the unseen layers of digital infrastructure, where security is an illusion and silence is a weapon. Whether it's code, configuration, or the human element—if it can be broken, it can be understood. And if it can be understood, it can be controlled.

Each entry here reflects a lesson learned, a boundary tested, or a veil lifted.

This isn’t a showcase.  
It’s a signal.  
To those who see the beauty in systems… and the elegance in subverting them.

Welcome to the other side.
