## #whoami

**I am Lord Sudo.**  

Red teamer. CTF tactician. Student of systems and their failure points.  
Proud operative of **p3rf3ctr00t**.

This space is not a blog. It is a ledger.  
A chronicle of engagements, extractions, exploits—both technical and psychological.

I navigate the unseen layers of digital infrastructure, where security is an illusion and silence is a weapon. 
Whether it's code, configuration, or the human element;
if it can be broken, it can be understood. 
if it can be understood, it can be controlled.

Each entry here reflects a lesson learned, a boundary tested, or a veil lifted.


Welcome to the other side.
