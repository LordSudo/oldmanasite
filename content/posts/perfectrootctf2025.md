# 🎉 Lights, Camera, Chaos!

If you heard loud keyboard smashing on the weekend of December 5th…  
yeah, that was probably us.

PerfectRoot CTF 2025 went live, thousands of players stormed the gates, the Discord server transformed into a marketplace of panic and memes, and somewhere in the background I was praying the infra wouldn’t spontaneously combust.

**Spoiler: it didn’t.**  
Miracles *do* happen.

# **PerfectRoot CTF 2025 — My Behind-the-Scenes Recap (Organized Chaos Done Right)**

PerfectRoot CTF 2025 is officially in the books — and wow, what a ride.  
This year’s event wasn’t just bigger… it was louder, faster, and way more chaotic in the best possible way. If last year was a warm-up jog, this year was a sprint uphill while juggling flaming Docker containers.

We kicked things off on **Friday, 5th December 2025 at 18:00 GMT+3**, but trust me, the planning started well before that.  
With **90 challenges**, a bigger crew, and players from around the world, this year came with big goals — and even bigger surprises.

## 🚀 Participation & Milestones

Two major targets for 2025:

- Hit **1000 participants**  
- Move from **shared challenge instances → dedicated team-based instances**

**Results?**  
We did not just hit the goals — we *drop-kicked* them:

- **1700+ participants**  
- **800+ teams**  
- **50+ countries** (yep… the whole planet basically showed up)  
- Fully isolated **per-team instances** — goodbye shared-instance chaos, hello smooth player experience

A very detailed blog on the infrastructure magic behind all this is coming soon, because that story deserves its own space. (Fellow nerds, I got you....)

## 🧩 Challenge Creation — OSINT, Crypto & Friends

I authored challenges in **OSINT** and **Crypto**, keeping them mostly on the easier side.  
But ironically, my “easy” OSINT challenge **LockPick** held out for **30+ hours** before First Blood.  
Apparently “easy” is subjective.

This year’s challenge lineup wouldn’t have been the same without the creators from **Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania**, and a **guest creator from Hacking Hub**.  
These guys delivered premium-quality challenges early, tested them, refined them — absolute lifesavers.

We also expanded the number of categories this year (details in the upcoming infra blog), making the CTF feel more complete and welcoming to all play styles.

## 🛠️ Teamwork & Support — SOC Shift Energy

The organizing team grew this year, and we ran support like a **SOC**, complete with schedules, rotations, and everything.

…well, except a few folks who just showed up for every shift, scheduled or not.  
Give them a medal.

Support this year?  
Peak chaos. **Beautiful chaos.**

- **300+ official tickets**  
- questions, nudges, clarifications  
- bug reports  
- and of course, people asking for the flag directly (dream big)

Meanwhile, on Day 1, our support bot mysteriously went into maintenance for a whole hour.  
Nobody told us.  
Players found out instantly.  
My DMs exploded.  
(These DMs are not included in the ticket count — they’re bonus trauma.)

The Discord server stayed on fire the entire 48 hours — tickets, memes, panics, solves, celebrations, and the classic *“the challenge is broken”* (95% of the time: it wasn’t).

## 💥 Plot Twist of the Week

At some point, our challenges GitHub repo decided to yeet itself back in time and “commit” to changes from three weeks earlier.  
To this day, we don’t know why.  
A very known unknown. (If you are reading this, your secrets are safe....)

Thankfully:  
**always have backups.**  
And we did (Luckily).  
Crisis averted.

## 📣 The Hype Machine

We pushed plenty of announcements leading up to the CTF, and the momentum pulled in a few new partners along the way.  
It’s always great to watch the community grow — not just in numbers, but in energy.

## 🎬 Behind the Scenes — Real Talk

There’s a specific adrenaline that only CTF organizers know.

It’s that moment when:

- the timer hits zero  
- players flood in  
- instances start spawning  
- Discord gets louder  
- your coffee cools down before you even remember where you left it  

You’re watching dashboards blink like Christmas lights while balancing excitement with *“please don’t break, please don’t break.”*

Behind the scenes, it’s:

- caffeine-fueled debugging  
- awkward 3AM voice chats  
- monitoring graphs like stock traders  
- people jumping in to help without being asked  
- half-panicked jokes  
- “did we really push that to prod?”  
- and realizing that players worldwide are enjoying something you built from scratch

It’s exhausting, chaotic, unpredictable —  
and honestly one of the most rewarding things I have done this year.

## 🎯 Wrapping Up & What’s Next

PerfectRoot CTF 2025 pushed our limits and set a new bar for what we can pull off.  
More players, more countries, more challenges, more chaos — and a whole lot more pride.

A full technical deep-dive into the **infrastructure, automation, deployment pipelines, and scaling tricks** is coming soon on the blog.

To everyone who played, created, panicked, solved, or spammed my DMs:  
**Thank you.**

See you in **PerfectRoot CTF 2026** — we’re just getting started.
